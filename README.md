# Today's Assignment ‚Äì 8 C Programming Problems

This repository contains a set of 8 C programming questions completed as part of daily practice or classwork. These programs help reinforce essential concepts of **structured programming** in the C language.

#Repository Overview

Each question is implemented in a separate `.c` file, with corresponding `.exe` files for direct execution on Windows. These programs are meant to build logic, improve syntax understanding, and strengthen control flow concepts in C.
